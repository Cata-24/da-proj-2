\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declares the \doxylink{classSolver}{Solver} class and its methods for solving the Delivery Truck \doxylink{classPallet}{Pallet} Packing Optimization Problem. 

This file defines the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classSolver}{Solver}} class, which provides interfaces for running different algorithmic strategies to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem, including brute-\/force, dynamic programming, approximation, and integer linear programming (\doxylink{classILP}{ILP}).
